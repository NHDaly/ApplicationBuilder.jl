## Deprecation Warning
This package is no longer supported. Almost everything this package did is now supported in [PackageCompiler.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/PackageCompiler.jl) itself, out of the box.

If you are still using this package, or want to continue its development, let me know and I can make you a maintainer! :)

Turn your julia program into a standalone, distributable, statically-compiled "App"!

ApplicationBuilder compiles a julia program and bundles it up into a distributable application, on macOS, Windows and Linux! After building, your users can download
your application and run it without having Julia installed.

## ApplicationBuilder

To compile and bundle your julia program into a distributable app, use `ApplicationBuilder.build_app_bundle`:
```julia
julia> using ApplicationBuilder
help?> build_app_bundle()
  # 1 method for generic function "build_app_bundle":
  build_app_bundle(juliaprog_main; appname, builddir, resources, libraries, verbose, bundle_identifier, app_version, icns_file, certificate, entitlements_file, snoopfile, autosnoop, commandline_app) in ApplicationBuilder at /Users/daly/.julia/v0.6/ApplicationBuilder/src/ApplicationBuilder.jl:47
```

## Usage
To build a julia program into an application, you'll need to do two steps:

1. Wrap your code in `julia_main` function. If the main entry-point to your code is a function, `my_code()`, it would look like this:
    ```julia
    # my_julia_main.jl
    include("my_code.jl")
    Base.@ccallable function julia_main(ARGS::Vector{String})::Cint
        return my_code()
    end
    ```
    The easiest thing to do is to maintain this as a separate script, but you can put this anywhere in your project.
1. Call `build_app_bundle` with the file that provides `julia_main`. The easiest way to do this is to maintain a build script, e.g.:
    ```julia
    # build.jl
    using ApplicationBuilder
    build_app_bundle("src/my_julia_main.jl", appname="MyCode");
    ```

## Compatibility

`ApplicationBuilder` supports macOS, Windows, and Linux.
Currently, ApplicationBuilder doesn't do cross-compilation, so to compile for
Windows, you need to run it from a Windows machine, etc.

## Running an example:
After cloning the repository, you can build an App out of the example program, `examples/hello.jl`, like this:

```julia
julia> build_app_bundle("$(homedir())/.julia/v0.6/ApplicationBuilder/examples/hello.jl", appname="HelloWorld", verbose=true);
```

or like this:

```bash
$ julia build_app.jl -v examples/hello.jl "HelloWorld"
```

This will produce `builddir/HelloWorld.app`, which you can double click, and it will indeed greet you!

The simple example HelloWorld.app has no binary dependencies -- that is, it
doesn't need any extra libraries besides Julia. Many Julia packages come bundled
with their own binary dependencies, and if you want to use them in your app,
you'll have to add those dependencies via the `libraries` (`-L`) option for libs
and `resources` (`-R`) for bundle resources.

### More examples
There are many more examples in the `examples` directory, each of which have a corresponding _build file_ in the `test/build_examples` directory. You can build an example simply by running the build file:
```julia
julia> include("$(homedir())/.julia/v0.6/ApplicationBuilder/test/build_examples/commandline_hello.jl")
```

## build_app.jl (The command-line tool)

There is also a command-line interface, through `build_app.jl`, if you prefer it. The main development is on the Julia API, though, so this sometimes lags behind. Feel free to send a PR if it's missing anything! :)

Run `julia build_app.jl -h` for help:
```
usage: build_app.jl [-v] [-R <resource>] [-L <file>] [--icns <file>]
                    [-h] juliaprog_main [appname] [builddir]

positional arguments:
  juliaprog_main        Julia program to compile -- must define
                        julia_main()
  appname               name to call the generated .app bundle
  builddir              directory used for building, either absolute
                        or relative to the Julia program directory
                        (default: "builddir")

optional arguments:
  -v, --verbose         increase verbosity
  -R, --resource <resource>
                        specify files or directories to be copied to
                        MyApp.app/Contents/Resources/. This should be
                        done for all resources that your app will need
                        to have available at runtime. Can be repeated.
  -L, --lib <file>      specify user library files to be copied to
                        MyApp.app/Contents/Libraries/. This should be
                        done for all libraries that your app will need
                        to reference at runtime. Can be repeated.
  --icns <file>         .icns file to be used as the app's icon
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

  examples:
     # Build HelloApp.app from hello.jl
     build_app.jl hello.jl HelloApp
     # Build MyGame, and copy in imgs/, mus.wav and all files in libs/
     build_app.jl -R imgs -R mus.wav -L lib/* main.jl MyGame
 ```
